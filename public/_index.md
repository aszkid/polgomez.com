### Hi there! I'm Pol, nice to meet you.

I'm a rising junior at the *University of Chicago*, pursuing a bachelor's degree in *Mathematics* and *Computer Science*.

You can see some of the code I've written on my spare time [over here](/); I am interested in cryptography and its applications, computer graphics, security, and anything low-level. As for mathematics, I have spent a summer working on [algebraic number theory](/) and I think [category theory](/) is very cool.

Please take a look at my [resume](/resume) for a career-oriented summary of most of the stuff you'll find on this website.

I also like books, [words](/words) and languages. My ongoing efforts on this front include trying to learn [latin](/latin) and [russian](/russian), translating some [texts](/translations) and working on a [literature database system](/litdb).

> Ideas occur to us when they please, not when it pleases us. The best ideas do indeed occur to one's mind in the way in which Ihering describes it: when smoking a cigar on the sofa; or as Helmholtz states of himself with scientific exactitude: when taking a walk on a slowly ascending street; or in a similar  way. In any case, ideas come when we do not expect them, and not when we are brooding and searching at our desks. Yet ideas would certainly not come to mind had we not brooded at our desks and searched for answers with passionate devotion.
