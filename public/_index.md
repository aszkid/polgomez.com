### Hi there! I'm Pol, nice to meet you.

I'm a rising junior at the University of Chicago, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.

You can see some of the code I've written on my spare time [over here](/about#projects); I am interested in machine learning, cryptography and its applications, computer graphics, security, and anything low-level; I am also passionate about decentralized web initiatives. As for mathematics, I have spent a summer working on [algebraic number theory](https://github.com/aszkid/number_theory) and I think [category theory](https://github.com/aszkid/polynomial-functor-notes) is very cool.

*Currently taking:* Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MATH 24620), Numerical Analysis (MATH 21100), Galois Theory (MATH 25900) and a reading course on Differential Geometry and Lie Groups.

I currently serve as vice president of the [UChicago Applied Math Club](https://ucamc.github.io), where we invite professors to give talks about their research related to or involving mathematics.

For a career-oriented summary of most of the stuff you'll find on this website, please check my [resume](/polgomez_CV.pdf). I also have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gomezp/), but I like this website better.

I also like books, [words](/about#words) and languages, including but not limited to russian and catalan, my mother tongue.

You can reach me at `gomezp`@`uchicago.edu`.

> Ideas occur to us when they please, not when it pleases us. The best ideas do indeed occur to one's mind in the way in which Ihering describes it: when smoking a cigar on the sofa; or as Helmholtz states of himself with scientific exactitude: when taking a walk on a slowly ascending street; or in a similar  way. In any case, ideas come when we do not expect them, and not when we are brooding and searching at our desks. Yet ideas would certainly not come to mind had we not brooded at our desks and searched for answers with passionate devotion.
