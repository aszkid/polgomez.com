These are the projects I've worked on as of lately.

### » [Blockchain by example](#)
Very much WIP. A barebones blockchain protocol implementation, very Bitcoin-y in many respects; written in Rust. Node-to-node (Msgpack-encoded TCP stream) and user-node (JSON-RPC) communication.

### » [CHIP-8 emulator](#)
My first hands-on experience with Rust, served as a first course on writing emulators and understanding how a CPU works at a basic level.

### » [OpenGL renderer](#)
An attempt at a rendering pipeline, implemented using OpenGL. Written in portable C++, heavily inspired by the [bitsquid](#) engine (later known as *Stingray*).

### » [Algebraic number theory](#)
Paper for Peter May's REU at The University of Chicago, written during the summer of 2018. An introduction to algebraic number theory from a somewhat modern perspective (number fields, ideal class group, group of units).

### » [Polynomial functors](#)
Learned about fundamental categorical constructions, and dived into the novel and exciting world of polynomials... at the categorial level, of course!

### » Russian
If you are studying russian, [here](https://github.com/aszkid/russian-anki) is my somewhat decent Anki deck with two years worth of vocabulary and verbs.

### » Catalan
My mother tongue; I write occasionally on literature, language and etymologies. Currently working on migrating an old Blogger site to this platform.
